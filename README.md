# netherlands

I'm stuck in ZA due to Covid and The Netherlands consulate is closed until further notice. To reduce my work to visit the consulate site everyday, I'm writing a Python script to check this information for me.

The milestones:
 - Create a script to scrap the page and provide the full text about the consulate status.
 - Change the script to work as Lambda and integrate with SNS.

Further improvements:
 - Check the text extracted from the site and have different behavior based on it.
